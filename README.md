# Keyboard
Select backtrack using keyboard keys "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", or "6"

Stop playing backtrack with the "Q" key

Play notes using keys "A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", and ";"

Drum sounds can be played using keys "C", "V", "B", "N", and "M"









<!-- 1) Create a Google Chrome Extension that when enabled
allows the user to select a backtrack and then use specified keys to 
play notes (or sounds potentially?) 

    We can test out a couple of backtracks and assign Eventlistener to certain keys - possibly num keys 0-9.
        When we press the specified toggle key, play looped backtrack/sound enabled 
            (would only need eventlistener keydown) USE LOOP IN HTML.
        When we press the specified note key, play sound until eventlistener keyup is triggered. 
            (needs both keydown and keyup)

2) Have a toggle key that turns on
"light show" mode that changes the screen's background color - we can make the color opacity lighter so we can still see the page itself.
(preferably to the beat of the music)
    When we press the specified toggle key - array of colors, api fetching, RGB values using Math.floor(Math.random() * 255) for each R/G/B 
    HOPEFULLY aligns with BPM of music. We can also use https://www.thecolorapi.com/
    We can also have a specified background for toggle music/backtracks, and apply NEW backgrounds/colors when pressing specified note keys.
        When we press the specified toggle key again - Clear all colors.  -->
